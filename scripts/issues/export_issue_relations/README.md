# Export Issue Relations

Exports all SafetyCulture issue relationship data to CSV. Fetches relationships between issues and other entities (inspections, actions, assets, etc.) using the Data Feed API.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r ../../../requirements.txt`
2. **Set API token**: Replace `TOKEN = ''` in `main.py` with your SafetyCulture API token
3. **Run script**: `python main.py`
4. **Check output**: Find `issue_relations.csv` in the script directory

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ and pip
- Valid SafetyCulture API token with issues read permissions
- Network access to SafetyCulture API

## Input Format

No input file required - fetches all issue relationships from your SafetyCulture account automatically.

## Output

Generates `issue_relations.csv` with the following fields:

- `id` - Composite relationship ID (unique identifier for the relationship)
- `from_id` - Source entity UUID (typically the issue ID)
- `to_id` - Target entity UUID (inspection, action, or asset ID)
- `rel_type` - Relationship type (e.g., ISSUE-INSPECTION, ISSUE-ACTION, ISSUE-ASSET)
- `rel_created_at` - Relationship creation timestamp (ISO 8601 format)

**Output filename**: `issue_relations.csv`

## Features

- **Sequential Pagination**: Automatically follows API pagination through all pages
- **Streaming CSV**: Memory-efficient writing (handles large datasets without memory issues)
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff for transient network errors
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Automatically waits when API rate limits are hit
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time page counts, throughput rate, and estimated time remaining
- **Consistent Output**: Writes to `issue_relations.csv`
- **Error Recovery**: Partial data saved on failure (all successfully fetched pages preserved)

## Performance

**Typical Performance:**
- Small datasets (<100 relations): 2-5 seconds
- Medium datasets (100-1000 relations): 10-30 seconds
- Large datasets (>1000 relations): 1-3 minutes
- Rate: ~2-3 pages per second (network dependent)

**Limitations:**
- Sequential pagination required (API design - cannot parallelize)
- Rate limits enforced by SafetyCulture API (automatically handled)
- No parallel processing possible for this endpoint

## API Reference

- **Endpoint**: `GET /feed/issue_relations`
- **Documentation**: [SafetyCulture API - Data Feed for Issue Relations](https://developer.safetyculture.com/reference/thepubservice_feedissuerelationships)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "TOKEN not set in script"

**Solution**: Open `main.py` and set your API token:
```python
TOKEN = 'scapi_your_token_here'
```

### Rate limit errors

**Solution**: Script automatically handles rate limits with retry logic. The script will wait for the duration specified by the API's `Retry-After` header before continuing.

### Empty CSV or no data

**Possible causes**:
- No issue relationships exist in your account
- Insufficient API permissions
- Issues not linked to any inspections, actions, or assets

**Solutions**:
1. Verify issues exist in your SafetyCulture account
2. Check that issues are linked to other entities (inspections, actions, assets)
3. Verify API token has `issues:read` permission
4. Check that the token is valid and not expired

### Connection timeout errors

**Possible causes**:
- Network connectivity issues
- SafetyCulture API downtime
- Firewall blocking outbound connections

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify SafetyCulture API status at [status.safetyculture.com](https://status.safetyculture.com)
3. Check firewall settings allow HTTPS to api.safetyculture.io
4. Script will auto-retry 3 times with exponential backoff

### Partial data / Export interrupted

**What happens**: If the export fails mid-way, all successfully fetched pages are saved to the CSV file.

**Recovery**:
1. Check the partial CSV file to see how many relationships were fetched
2. Note the last relationship ID in the file
3. Re-run the script to fetch a complete dataset
4. You can manually merge or compare files if needed

## Notes

- **Read-only operation**: Script only reads data (no modifications to your account)
- **Memory efficient**: Streams data directly to CSV (no memory buildup)
- **Partial recovery**: On failure, partial data is automatically saved
- **Safe to re-run**: Overwrites previous output file with fresh data
- **Token security**: Never commit TOKEN to version control
- **Dynamic fields**: CSV headers adapt to API response structure

## Security

- Never commit your API token to version control
- The `.gitignore` file excludes `*.csv` files by default
- Always clear the TOKEN variable before committing code changes
- Store tokens securely (environment variables or secret management tools)

## Use Cases

This script is useful for:
- **Audit trails**: Track which issues are linked to which inspections
- **Analytics**: Analyze relationships between issues and actions
- **Compliance**: Document issue resolution workflows
- **Reporting**: Generate reports showing issue-to-asset mappings
- **Data migration**: Export relationship data for system migrations
- **Integration**: Feed data into BI tools or data warehouses
